  * **npm** or **Yarn** (package manager)
  * **MongoDB** (running locally or access to a cloud instance)
  * **Git**

### Installation

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nutrivista.git
    cd nutrivista
    ```

2.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    cd frontend # Assuming your frontend code is in a 'frontend' directory
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../backend # Assuming your backend code is in a 'backend' directory
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in both the `frontend` and `backend` directories (if applicable) and populate them with necessary environment variables. Refer to `.env.example` files if provided in respective directories.

      * **Backend `.env` example:**
        ```
        PORT=3000
        MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/nutrivista
